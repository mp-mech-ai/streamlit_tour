# :camera: streamlit-tour

A [Driver.js](https://driverjs.com/) integration for [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - add beautiful, interactive guided tours to your Streamlit apps with a single Python call.

![streamlit-tour demo](assets/streamlit-tour-demo.gif)


## Features

- :link: **Bind tour steps to any Streamlit widget** by its `key`
- :window: **Element-free info steps** - show contextual popups not anchored to any component
- :white_check_mark: **One-time tours** - automatically skip tours the user has already completed (via `localStorage`)
- :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: **State feedback** - know exactly when a tour was finished, dismissed, or skipped
- :art: **Configurable** - control overlay opacity, animations, progress indicators, and popover alignment


## Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit-tour
```
Or in a more modern way:

```bash
uv add streamlit-tour
```


## Quickstart

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_tour import Tour

st.title("My App")
st.text_input("Name", key="name_input")

tour = Tour(
    steps=[
        Tour.bind("name_input", title="Your Name", desc="Enter your name here."),
        Tour.info(title="That's it!", desc="You're ready to go."),
    ]
)

tour.start()
```


## Usage

### `Tour.start()`

Launches the tour. Call this inside any conditional block (e.g. a button click) or make sure to specify `one_time_tour=True`.


### `Tour.result`
Stores a TourStatus object with the tour's current state:

| Key            | Type   | Description                                          |
|----------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `currentStep`  | `int`  | Last step index the user reached                     |
| `dismissed`    | `bool` | `True` if the user closed the tour before finishing  |
| `finished`     | `bool` | `True` if the user completed all steps               |
| `skipped`      | `bool` | `True` if the tour was skipped (one-time, already seen) |

### `Tour.bind()`

---

Attaches a tour step to a Streamlit widget via its `key`.

```python
Tour.bind(
    key="my_widget_key",        # Must match the widget's key= argument
    title="Step Title",
    desc="Step description text.",
    side="bottom",              # "top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right" (optional)
    align="center",             # "start" | "center" | "end" (optional)
)
```

> **How it works:** `Tour.bind` resolves the widget using Streamlit's `.st-key-<key>` CSS class, which is automatically injected on any widget that has a `key=` argument.


### `Tour.info()`

---

Creates a floating step with no element anchor - useful for introductory or summary slides.

```python
Tour.info(
    title="Welcome!",
    desc="This tour will walk you through the main features of this app.",
)
```


## One-Time Tour

Set `one_time_tour=True` to automatically skip the tour for users who have already seen it. Completion is tracked in the browser's `localStorage` using the tour's `key`.

```python
Tour.start(
    steps=[...],
    one_time_tour=True,
    key="onboarding_tour",   # Must be unique and stable across reruns
)
```

To reset the tour (e.g. for testing), clear `localStorage` in your browser's DevTools, or use a different `key`.

Check out `example.py` file for a complete example of usage.

## Tips

- **Always provide a `key`** when using `one_time_tour=True` or when you have multiple tours on the same page.
- **Widgets must have a `key=` argument** for `Tour.bind()` to locate them. Anonymous widgets (no `key`) are not bindable.
- **Re-triggering a tour:** Change the `key` value between Streamlit reruns to force the tour to restart.
- **Column layouts:** Use `side` and `align` on `Tour.bind()` to control which side the popover appears on narrow widgets.


## Roadmap / Possible Improvements

- [X] **Better output** - make the Tour returns an object instead of a simple dict
- [ ] **Tabs and Pages** - make the Tour navigate between tabs and pages (maybe with an intermediate Python actions ?)
- [ ] **`Tour.reset()`** - a utility function to clear the one-time-tour flag from `localStorage`
- [X] **Step grouping** - define multiple named tours and selectively launch them
- [ ] **Theme support** - CSS variable overrides to match Streamlit's light/dark mode
- [ ] **Driver.js parameters** - implement all the other Driver.js options
